## Hi there this is my **personal page**

### A few things about me:

- I'm not a computer science major, rather, an electrical and computer engineer (I'm in this class because I was too lazy to switch classes)
- I'm from the Bay Area in California
- I know Python, C, and C++ (and node.js but it's been a few years so I'm pretty rusty)
